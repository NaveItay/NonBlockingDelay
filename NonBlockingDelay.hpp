 *    NonBlockingDelay Library
 * 
 * @brief
 *    This library provides non-blocking delay functionality for Arduino projects, allowing for timed operations
 *    without halting other processes. It is particularly useful in scenarios where maintaining program flow is
 *    essential while waiting for a certain period.
 *
 *    The `NonBlockingDelay` class enables easy setup and checking of delays, facilitating time-based tasks without
 *    the constraints of traditional blocking delay functions.
 *
 * Usage:
 *    1. Create an instance of the `NonBlockingDelay` class.
 *    2. Use the `check()` method to determine if the set interval has elapsed.
 *    3. Execute code after the interval has passed, as indicated by `check()`.
 *
 * Example:
 *    NonBlockingDelay delay(1000); // 1000 milliseconds delay
 *    if (delay.check()) {
 *      // Code to execute after 1 second
 *    }
